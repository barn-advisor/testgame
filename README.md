# testgame

a little something to test my Python skills

i think i made this at 3 am at first, now it's become this

developmnt is slow mainly cuz no time to do shit + enemies.py triggers my laziness

## files

main - initializes dictionaries andl oads moduekmdfdljgn

gameshop.py - thought keeping verything in one file was too bad so i made a module for the shop

savingmdl.py - referenced as sv in main, saves (soon will also load)

development is halting soon and i think itll end at enemies.py :(

## requirements

كيف يمكنني أن أقتل نفسي

linux

python 3.x

## contributing

why would you? even though it would be both helpful and a waste of time

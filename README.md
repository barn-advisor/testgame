# Simple Python Game

as it says, it's a simple python game

## files

main.py - The backbone of the whole code. Run this file.

gameshop.py - Self-explainatory

saveload.py - Saves and loads the game data

enemies.py - partially WIP, deals with the fighting mechanics

globals.py - where all the dictionaries and global varaibles are initialized

h.txt - the most important file in the project, removing it will break the entire code

## requirements

* a terminal
* common sense
* python 3.x

## running
on linux: 
python3.x main.py

on windows: 
py main.py

on mac:
no (probably sÄƒme as linux)
